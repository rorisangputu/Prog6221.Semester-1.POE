# Prog6221.Semester1.POE

This is the first part of my semester 3 Programming Portfolio Of Evidence (POF).

The task was to create a Recipe app. The application must give you the option to add a recipe, display, scale it, reset the scale, and clear the recipe. The application should give you a an option to exit the program, as well as produce an invalid input if user doesn't pick a valid option on the menu.
